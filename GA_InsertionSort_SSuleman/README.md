Guided Assignment - Implementing Insertion Sort in C#
Introduction
Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by building the final sorted array one element at a time. It is called "Insertion Sort" because it repeatedly takes an element from the unsorted part of the array and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.

Pseudocode
procedure insertionSort(arr: List of Comparable)
    // Get the length of the input array
    arrayLength = length(arr)
    
    // Iterate through the array starting from the second element
    for currentIndex from 1 to arrayLength - 1
        // Store the current element's value
        currentValue = arr[currentIndex]

        // Initialize the position for comparing the current element
        previousIndex = currentIndex - 1

        // Shift elements of the sorted part that are greater than currentValue
        while previousIndex >= 0 and arr[previousIndex] > currentValue
            arr[previousIndex + 1] = arr[previousIndex]
            previousIndex = previousIndex - 1
        end while

        // Place the current element at its correct position
        arr[previousIndex + 1] = currentValue
    end for
end procedure

Step By Step
Step 1:
In this step, we start the InsertionSortArray method. Here's the code with comments:

static void InsertionSortArray(int[] arr)
{
    // 1. Calculate the length of the array
    int arrayLength = arr.Length;

    // 2. Start a loop from the second element
    for (int currentIndex = 1; currentIndex < arrayLength; currentIndex++)
    {
        // 3. Internal Code
    }
}
We calculate the length of the input array using int arrayLength = arr.Length.

We start a for loop with currentIndex initialized to 1, which represents the second element of the array. This loop iterates through the array elements, excluding the first one.

Step 2:
In this step, we provide more details in the InsertionSortArray method. Here's the code with comments:

static void InsertionSortArray(int[] arr)
{
    int arrayLength = arr.Length;
    for (int currentIndex = 1; currentIndex < arrayLength; currentIndex++)
    {
        // 1. Store the value of the current element in currentValue
        int currentValue = arr[currentIndex];

        // 2. Initialize previousIndex to one position before currentIndex
        int previousIndex = currentIndex - 1;

        // 3. Start a loop to move elements greater than currentValue
        //    one position ahead of their current position
        while (previousIndex >= 0 && arr[previousIndex] > currentValue)
        {
            // Internal Code
        }

        // 4. Place currentValue at its correct position in the sorted part of the array
        arr[previousIndex + 1] = currentValue;
    }
}
We store the value of the current element at index currentIndex in the variable currentValue.

We initialize previousIndex to be one position before currentIndex, which represents the index of the element immediately before the current one.

We start a while loop to move elements greater than currentValue one position ahead of their current position. This loop compares elements and potentially shifts them.

After the while loop, we place currentValue at its correct position in the sorted part of the array.

Step 3:
In this step, we focus on the details within the while loop. Here's the code with comments:

while (previousIndex >= 0 && arr[previousIndex] > currentValue)
{
    // 1. Shift the element to the right
    arr[previousIndex + 1] = arr[previousIndex];

    // 2. Decrement previousIndex to move to the previous element
    previousIndex = previousIndex - 1;
}

// 3. Place currentValue at its correct position in the sorted part of the array
arr[previousIndex + 1] = currentValue;
Inside the while loop, we shift the element at previousIndex to the right by assigning arr[previousIndex] to arr[previousIndex + 1]. This step ensures that we make room for currentValue in the correct position.

We decrement previousIndex by 1 to move to the previous element in the array.

After the while loop, we place currentValue at its correct sorted position by assigning it to arr[previousIndex + 1]. This step completes the insertion of currentValue into the sorted portion of the array.

These comments and numbered explanations should help clarify where specific actions are happening in the code.

Final Test
Code to add
using System;

class Program
{
    static Random random = new Random();

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int size = 10; // Change the size of the array as needed
        int minValue = 1; // Change the minimum value as needed
        int maxValue = 100; // Change the maximum value as needed

        int[] randomArray = GenerateRandomIntArray(size, minValue, maxValue);

		// Display your array in it's unsorted form

		// Call your bubble sort method

		// Display your method after its been sorted
    }

    static int[] GenerateRandomIntArray(int size, int minValue, int maxValue)
    {
        if (size <= 0 || minValue > maxValue)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid arguments");
        }

        int[] arr = new int[size];
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
        {
            arr[i] = random.Next(minValue, maxValue + 1);
        }
        return arr;
    }

}
